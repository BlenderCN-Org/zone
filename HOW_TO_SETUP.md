# HOW TO SETUP ZONE APPLICATION AND RUN RENDERBOX

## For very basic users Just follow 3 steps and your Zone Application will be up and running.

### STEP 01 - Python and Packages Installation
Python 3.6 with pip
after python installation go to scripts folder and run __INSTALL_PACKAGES.bat
(__INSTALL_PACKAGES.bat will install all required python packages)

### STEP 02 - Build Database

in Production Environment we will use MySQL database.

To setup database go to scripts folder and run __BUILD_DATABASE.bat
